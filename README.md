# Survey form with React

This project is to use React to build a survey form. The survey should consist of at least 3 questions. One question should use radio buttons and one should use a select dropdown. When the user presses submit, they should see a summary of their answers. 

## The problem

I started by making components of the different questions but finally I put the questions in one component and the summary in another. I used props in the summary section and states in the app component.

If I had more time I would have made different pages for each question. I would have styled the radio buttons and the checkboxes much more, for example with bounce animations and other colors. I would also add more images.
